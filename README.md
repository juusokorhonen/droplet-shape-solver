Simple Young-Laplace equation solver for small droplets

## Installation

This package is currently targeting Python version 3.10 and above.

If you just want to install the latest verions, run the following pip install command:

  pip install https://github.com/juusokorhonen/droplet-shape-solver/

## Developer installation

If you want to develop this package, then you can install it locally in editable mode.

### Using Makefile

  make prepare-dev
  make dev-install

#### CPython 3.10.11

  pyenv install 3.10.11
  pyenv local 3.10.11

#### Upgrade essential packages and create virtual environment

Regardless of the Python version, you should run these commands.

  cd /path/to/adsa

  python -V
  >  Python 3.10.11

  python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools setuptools_scm virtualenv py-make build
  python -m virtualenv venv
  source venv/bin/activate   # Linux, MacOS
  .\venv\Source\activate
  python -m pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-tests.txt -r requirements-extras.txt

#### Install adsa in editable mode

  python -m pip install -e /path/to/adsa


### Windows and MinGW

Make sure you have a proper Python installed with the `py` wrapper. Here, I assume version 3.7 of Python, but you can use a later one as well.

Run these commands in the root folder of the project (ie. the folder wher this README.md file is).

  py -3.7 -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel virtualenv py-make
  py -3.7 -m virtualenv venv
  source venv/Scripts/activate
  python -m pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt -r requirements-extras.txt

#### Install adsa in editable mode

    python -m pip install -e .

## Run examples

    python -m adsa.examples.droplet_shape_simulation
    python -m adsa.examples.three_d_shape.py

## Run cli
